# nlp-421

An exploratory project to get and process GloVe embeddings for use in a NLP neural network. 

## Usage

* Run main.py

```terminal
python main.py
```

## Current Status

* Currently focusing on leveraging pre-built methods from torchtext and torchnlp to get datasets and load vectors for nn training. 
* See branch torchtext

## Resources

* GloVe: [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
