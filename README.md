# nlp-421

An exploratory project to get and process GloVe embeddings for use in a NLP neural network. 

## Usage

* Get Started From Terminal

* Project created with Anaconda version (conda=4.9.2)

```terminal
# make new conda environment (optional but recommended)
conda create -n nlp-421

# activate conda environment (if using your own env)
conda activate nlp-421

# install requirements (a wrapper for pip install)
make install
```

* Run Script With Defaults
```terminal
make run
```

## Current Status

* Currently focusing on leveraging pre-built methods from torchtext and torchnlp to get datasets and load vectors for nn training. 
* See branch torchtext
